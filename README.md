# LethalAction
Shadows of Doubt mod for allowing the player to kill Citizens.

This the is the source-code for said mod and also a [download](https://github.com/IgnizGitHub/LethalAction/releases/tag/v1.0.0) area. 

When Citizens are stunned (knocked out), you can hit them with weapons, thrown items, and etc to kill them. 

It depends on the weapon's damage on how many hits it takes. Thrown items may take several times. 

You will know they are dead when you search the body and see the time of death and type of weapon used.

There are likely bugs or things I simply didn't consider when making the mod, so please let me know about them.

If you have any questions or contributions you can contact me through the [Shadows of Doubt discord](https://discord.gg/45VsnXECMT), I'm IgnizHerz. (I may not see your PR on here immediately)
